# TopOpt.jl
A port of the infamous 99-line MATLAB Topology Optimization script to Julia

Given the quick growth  in Julia, I welcome researchers to help us develop this library further. Please contact us for joining the repo. 
What needs to be done:
1. handle input bounday conditions in more succinct manner
2. use faster matrix solver
  a. what about using JuliaFEM?
